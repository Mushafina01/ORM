# Django Project: Movie-Actor Relationship & Review System

This Django project consists of two core components:

1. **Movie-Actor Relationship** – Models a many-to-many relationship between Movies and Actors.
2. **Review System** – Allows users to review a movie, but ensures only one review per user per movie using `UniqueConstraint`.

## Features

- Manage movies and actors with a many-to-many relationship.
- Users can leave reviews for movies (one per user per movie).
- Fully integrated with Django Admin for easy data management.
- Database-level uniqueness constraint on reviews.

---

## Highlights
- One movie can feature multiple actors, and one actor can act in multiple movies.
- One user can review a specific movie only once.
- Admin interface includes search and filtering for all models.
- filter_horizontal improves UX for assigning actors to movies.
